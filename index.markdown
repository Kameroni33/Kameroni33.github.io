This is a temporary Jekyll host site that I quickly put together on GitHub Pages in order to host my resume (and eventually personal website). I have plans to completely overhaul the site shortly (likely switch to a Vue based website), so stay tuned for that! In the meantime, you can browse my current resume here - don't hesitate to reach out to me at either [ronaldk1@myumanitoba.ca]() or [khr675@gmail.com]().
